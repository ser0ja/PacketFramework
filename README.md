PacketFramework
=============

PacketFramework is a packet editing framework for World of Warcraft. You may create, send, modify, intercept, block, ... packets with your LUA scripts. The only limit is your imagination.

## Build & Usage

This project is a DLL, which you'll need to inject into your running WoW.exe process. Only x86 (32-bit) version of the game is supported at the moment.

The framework tries to locate your scripts under the 'World of Warcraft/Scripts' folder. In order to prevent unexpected errors with malformed custom scripts, you need to copy the PacketFramework.lua first into the Scripts directory.
